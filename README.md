## apples-vs-oranges
In this Python example we're providing a list of fruit and try to classify them as apples or oranges.
For simplicity, we're using the weight of the fruit and the roughness of it's skin.
If it's rough we're almost sure it's an orange. If it's smooth we're almost sure it's an apple.
